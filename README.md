#  EVENT GUEST LIST MANAGER
This here is a project that allows people to add guests or visitors to an event that they attend.
The main aim is that once a user inputs the guest's name, they should see ;
*  The name of the guest
*  The category the guest holds
*  A Remove  button that removes the guest name 
*  An add button that adds the guest's name

# How to use it
Simply input the name of the guest you want to add, categorize them according to your preference, then simply click the button to add them to the list. 

# THE AUTHORS

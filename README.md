#  EVENT GUEST LIST MANAGER
This here is a project that allows people to add guests or visitors to an event that they attend.
The main aim is that once a user inputs the guest's name, they should see ;
*  The name of the guest
*  The category the guest holds
*  A Remove  button that removes the guest name 
*  An add button that adds the guest's name

# How to use it
You can add guests by entering their names, categorizing them according to your preference, and then clicking the button to add them to the list. 

# THE AUTHORS
To put it simply, Daniel Kariuki Ndungu created this project as a contribution to an individual project.
